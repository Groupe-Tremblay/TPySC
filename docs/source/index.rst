TPSC is a Python library that allows the computation of Hubbard model related functions and quantities (such as the self-energy and Green's function) using the Two-Particle-Self-Consistent (TPSC) approach first described in `[Vick and Tremblay, 1997] <https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9702188>`_.

TPSC is developped at the Institut Quantique of Sherbrooke University (Quebec, Canada) by students of Andr√©-Marie Tremblay group.
It aims to provide a ready-to-use implementation of the TPSC method and some functions to post-process the results of the calculation.
